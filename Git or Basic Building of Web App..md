* Git is version control system . It was developed by **Linux Torvalds** in 2005.
* It is open source here many developer coordinate to each other and create a project .
* With the help of git developer keep track of code changes.
* It is easy to learn and fast performance .

## **Why use Git  :-**

* One of best features of Git . It supports **Offline** working
*  It is fast and easy to learn and aslo  user friendly .
* The 70% of developer use Git .
*

## **Basic Building  Blocks Of Web Application Development :-**


```bash
- Programming Languages 
- IP Address 
- Port 
- DNS 
- Code Editor 
- HTTP Verbs/Codes
- Database
- Software Licences
- Cloud 
- Project Management 
- Infrastructure 
```

* **Programming languages :-** 
>Programming is language that is used by developer,It is used to communicate with computer.
* *Here is some  important programming* :
* JavaScript
* Java 
* Python
* HTML
* Ruby 
* C 
* C++
* C#
* PHP 
* SQL 
* Swift

* **IP Adress :-**
> IP Adress is unique number, with the help this number we track system on internet or local network.
* there are IP adrees have two type :-

> ip v4 :- ip v4 hava a limitation of ip that is reason in 2005/2006 created ip v6.

> ip v6 :- ip v6 is the updated version of ip v4. It took 128 bit , it is very difficult  to remember.


## **Classification of IP address :-** 

| Class  | Range   | Used for              |               
|--------|---------|----------             |               
| Class A | 0-127  | Reseverd for local system|
| Class B | 128-191| It is used for Internet |
| Class C | 192-223| It is used for Local Network|
| Class D | 224-239| Not used /Reserved|
| Class E | 240-255| Not used |

>**Only Class A ,Class B, Class C are used for System or Application** .


## Port :- 
> **Port is nothing but it is entry point of any application** 


## **Port Range :-**

* (0-1023) It is reserved port used by system
* (1024-49150) It is application port .
* (49151-65535) It is a open port .


## **DNS :-**  
> **DNS is Stands for Domain Name System**
*  It is responsible for translating domain names into a specific IP address so that the client can load the requested Internet resources.


## **Code Editior  :-** 
* Visual Studio code (vscode) 
* Eclipse 
* NetBeans 
* Sublime Text 
* Pycharm 

## **HTTP & HTTPS :-**

**HTTP**
```
HTTP is Stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocal.
HTTP is most widely used protocal for transfer data over
the web.
As we know http is not secure anybody can read on internet that is reason https was introduced.
```  

**HTTPS**
```
HTTPS is http + Cryptographic Protocal.  
It is also know as transfer protocal, but is safe as compare to http.
For banking transaction we are using https protocal.
```


## **Software License :-** 
> Any software development not happen without software license .It is important document for development of software .
* here some open source licensed application 
  * Apache 2.0
  * MIT 
  * BSD  (Used for linux )
  * GPL
  * Mozila 

## **DataBase  :-** 
> A database is a systematic collection of data , with the help of  database we can easily managed ,update our  data .

* **There is two type of database**

  1. Relational Database 
  2. Non-Realational database

1)  Relational Database 

* They are use in company 
  * MySQL
  * PostgreSQL
  * MariaDB

2) Non-Realation Database
   * MongoDB
   * Redis 
   * Cassandra 

## **Cloud** **Provider** 
* AWS 
* Azure 
* Bluemix 
* DigitalOcean
* Linode

## **Git-Dev WorkFlow :-** 
* Feature branch
* Develop branch 
* Stage branch
* Master branch (Deployed to Production )
